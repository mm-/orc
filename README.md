# orc
Horrible C client for the ObjectRocket API

First attempt at teaching myself C from nothing with a tiny project

I'd recommend not using it for anything, and not using it as an example for anything, aside from possibly what not to do when coding in C

Usage:

orc -a $API_KEY

Right now it will only perform the default action of showing space usage for the instance. In the future you'll be able to specify the action as a second parameter after API_KEY.
